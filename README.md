Universal Windows App, written in VB.net, for controlling Domoticz (www.domoticz.com)

Initial goal of this app is to provide a Domoticz App in the Windows Store for use on Windows 10 Mobile devices. Secondary goal is to allow the app to run on Windows 10 IoT, in conjunction with a Pi2 and Touchscreen in order to allow the app to be used as a (wallmounted) controller for Domoticz. IoT is still Beta, and support for touchscreens for Windows 10 IoT is very limited at this time (the only one MS has on their hardware compatibility list seems sold out and provided by a very small company in Malaysia

Support for Windows 10 (tablet/pc) is basically automatically implemented.

The App will only interface with Domoticz for primary tasks, as reading out devices and switching devices on off. The App's intention is NOT to be able to create/modify/delete devices from within Domoticz. The webGUI of Domoticz is a much better place for doing this.

The Master release will contain a WIP version of the app, with all latest commits. Releases that make it to the Windows Store will be marked as seperate versions.
