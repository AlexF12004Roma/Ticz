Universal Windows App, written in VB.net, for controlling Domoticz (www.domoticz.com)

Initial goal of this app is to provide a Domoticz App in the Windows Store for use on Windows 10 Mobile devices. Additional support for Windows 10 (tablet/pc) and Windows 10 IoT will be implemented as secondary goals.

The App will only interface with Domoticz for primary tasks, as reading out devices and switching devices on off. The App's intention is NOT to be able to create/modify/delete devices from within Domoticz. The webGUI of Domoticz is a much better place for doing this.

The Master release will contain a WIP version of the app, with all latest commits. Releases that make it to the Windows Store will be marked as seperate versions.
